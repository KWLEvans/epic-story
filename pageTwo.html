    <h2>Act I</h2>
    <p>After cobbling for so many years, our nameless protagonist and his extremely named dog, Dogdog, decided to set off on a journey. But not like too crazy of a journey. It was pretty low-key. But for them, you know, that was kind of tough because they were old. You could even say that it was epic. And I would suggest that you say that.</p>
    <p>Gathering their most precious belongings, namely shoes, they set off to the mythical "store" they had heard so much about. It was rumored that shoes were abundant and economical at the supposed "store". They had to see for themselves!</p>
